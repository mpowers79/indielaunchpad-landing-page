            <h2>The Founder's Circle - A One-Time Offer</h2>
            <img src="images/placeholder.jpg" alt="Photo of Mike" class="headshot">
            <p>Hi, I’m Mike. I’ve spent my career on both the development and publishing sides of the games industry. As a publisher, my favorite role was partnering with indie studios, which gave me a firsthand look at a painful truth: great games die in silence all the time.
</p>
            <p>I’m building IndieLaunchPad to fix that. This is a solo project, and your early support means the world to me.</p>
            <p>IndieLaunchPad will launch at $39/month. For the first 20 founders who support this project, you get your entire first year for a single payment of <b>$49</b>. You’ll help shape the product, and as a thank you, you <b>lock in that special annual price forever</b>.
